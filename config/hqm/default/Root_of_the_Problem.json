You can use it to imbue magical effects onto Roots Staves through Spell Dusts! The first effect you should imbue is the Growth Supplication effect. To do so, simply place down the Imbuer, put the Growth Supplication Spell Dust inside, then place your Staff on top. Wait a couple seconds and it\u0027ll be magically imbued!\n\nStaves have 5 slots that spells can be imbued to. To use some of these however, you\u0027ll need specific components. Hovering over the imbued Staff will show you which materials you need. Specifically, for the Grove Supplication, you\u0027ll need a tiny bit of Terra Moss and Wildroot. You can store them in your inventory, or preferrably in a Component Pouch.","x":223,"y":22,"icon":{"id":"roots:imbuer"},"prerequisites":["949e73a4-f1d8-4e0b-90ac-299e762f2c47"],"tasks":[{"type":"DETECT","items":[{"item":{"id":"roots:imbuer"}}]}],"reward":[{"id":"plustic:alumiteingot","amount":12}],"commandrewards":[]},{"uuid":"32424c8f-457f-4ea3-a8d0-15b752a89168","name":"Wood you look at that!","description":"Perform the Wildroot Growth Ritual on your Pyre (the Ritual is available from JEI), while one fully grown Wildroot plant is nearby.
