The result was: Implement an item that lets you skip the Twilight Forest, since many of us players have already completed it, and there is nothing new to see.\n\nIf you wish to skip the Twilight Forest, craft a Twilight Key. This will allow you to craft the Lamp of Cinders, which would otherwise be the final item obtained in the Forest, and allow you to progress further into the pack.\n\nHowever, if you haven\u0027t played through Twilight Forest yet, I highly encourage you to try it out, since it\u0027s most likely the single best exploration mod in Minecraft - especially if OP flight methods aren\u0027t available. The best way to travel through Twilight in this pack is with the Roots Sky Soarer spell, as well as Tinkers\u0027 Slime Boots and Slimestring.\n\nDue to Twilight\u0027s popularity though, it\u0027s incredibly overused: it\u0027s included in a large portion of packs, which is understandably why people get bored of it.\n\nSo if you wish to follow this route, you don\u0027t have to enter the Twilight Forest to go on.","x":274,"y":52,"icon":{"id":"contenttweaker:twilight_key"},"prerequisites":["db9eed7a-7a42-4df3-b9fd-4b4759c8d31d"],"tasks":[{"type":"DETECT","items":[{"item":{"id":"contenttweaker:twilight_key"}}]}],"commandrewards":[]},{"uuid":"e92cfa12-0f13-4275-a7d2-b819c66db0a8","name":"On Scorched Ground","description":"Summon and defeat the King of Scorchers in the Nether!
