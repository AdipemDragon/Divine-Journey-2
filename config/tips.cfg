		There are 4 main stages: 1) Early game Exploration, 2) The Big Tech Block, 3) Magic Mods, 4) Lategame OP Stuff.
		Use a Ruler or a Tape Measure to get the distance between two blocks!
		Hamburgers are a really good early game food source once you have a Wheat, a Cow, and a Chicken farm!

		All Blood Magic Essences from 1.7.10 make a return!
		Setup your Immersive Engineering Excavator in multiple locations to find plenty of different ores!
		Vanilla Hoes have a very low base durability. Use the Tinkers' Construct Mattock!
		Much different from Divine Journey 1, unique recipes, unique progression, and more things to do!
		This is an Expert pack, so most recipes are more difficult.
		The end goal is to find the meaning of life... What could it be?!
		You can convert Blood Magic Life Essence and EvilCraft Blood after Tier 5 Blood Magic.
		AE2 Autocrafting is only available after most other Tech Mods, on the 13th Quest Page.

		Press 'K' to open your Quests!
		Don't know what to do? Check which quests you have recently unlocked!
		Automate everything!
		Making everything automated from the get-go will make every new Quest page go much smoothly!
		Don't know how to automate something? Visit the CurseForge Divine Journey 2 page!
		Neat is a mod by Vazkii.
		Did you get any of the references in the Quest Book? ;)
		Way less grindy lategame than in Divine Journey 1!
		Stuck in Erebus? You can find the materials inside the dimension to create another Gateway Key.
		Some Roots Spells make it much easier to traverse some early game dimensions!
		Watch out, don't let 'Atum' be 'a tomb' for you! ;)
		Bewitchment is the rewitchment of Witchery.
		There are many custom dungeons in DivineRPG dimensions added by the community!
		There are many custom dungeons in Galacticraft dimensions added by the community!
		Automating the Rainbow Generator is a challenge, but rewards you with a lot of RF/tick.
		Extreme Reactors generate way more power than default.
		Water Mills have been nerfed, other GP Generators have been buffed.
		Starting from Blood Magic, everything is a lot more expensive. We expect you to automate everything!
		Watch out for poisonous mushrooms in the Nether!
		If you fall off in a void dimension, you'll just loop back around to the top.
		There is a lot more Glowstone in the Nether! You'll need it.
		Is your base laggy? Make sure to extend it horizontally rather than vertically!

		Wanna claim an area? Open your inventory and click the Map icon on the top left!
		Join the Divine Journey 2 Discord Server from the Title Screen link!

		Herobrine was removed in the latest update.
		Experts say automating everything is the best way to beat this pack...!

		Blood Magic Potions have 8 swigs instead of just 1!
		Make sure to bring Fire Resistance into the Erebus and the Dreadlands!
		Wither Skeletons no longer drop the Drop of Evil. It's craftable! (Craft of Evil?!)
		Lesser Shoggoths and Shoggoth Lairs are disabled. Everything you can obtain from them is craftable instead!
		Cursed Earth is by far the best way to farm mobs in the early game!
		I heard you like complicated recipes, so I put a recipe inside a recipe so you can recipe with your recipes!
		Watch out for Pumpkins and Cacti! Why? Fooooorrr no reason, totally...!
		Wanna add a mod you like? In you're playing in Singleplayer, then feel free to do so! And if it's a client-only mod, you can use it on servers too!
		Do you have something annoying that you constantly need to craft? Better automate it!
		Tinkers' Tools are great in the early game, but aren't meant to serve you the entire pack! Use DivineRPG, AbyssalCraft, EnderIO, and later Draconic Evolution Tools!
		The Akashic Tome is a way to store Books from multiple mods in just 1 item.
		The Morphing Tool is a way to store wrenches from multiple mods in just 1 item.
		The Well of Suffering Ritual is the best way to automate Blood Magic LP gain.
		To automate Blood Magic Will generation, use a combination of 3 Rituals: Gathering of the Forsaken Souls, Crack of the Fractured Crystal & Ritual of Zephyr.
		If a craft requires a lower level Blood Magic Orb, a higher level one will also work.
		Feeling tired? Take a break and come back tomorrow!
		Not generating enough music for Totemic? Try using many different instruments, multiple Drums and multiple Wind Chimes! If you have a friend, you can both generate music!
		Chisels & Bits is in the pack, but if you're playing Singleplayer, feel free to add more mods that help you build!
		You can ignite the Roots Pyre from the bottom with a Dispenser with a Flint & Steel inside.

		There are 6 tiers of Leather you'll need to craft throughout the pack.
		There are 13 tiers of Machine Frames you'll need to craft throughout the pack. Make sure to automate them so you don't have to go through each step every time!
		Ore Excavator is in the pack, so make sure to use it from the start! It makes mining way simpler.
		If you're using a lot of Mekanism Universal Cables, your base might get a bit laggy. Try to find other alternatives!
		If you're using a lot of Crafting Cards, your ME System might get a very laggy. Try to instead setup Level Emitters or craft stuff on demand!
		There are 5 new tiers of AE2 Processors. Higher tiers gate larger Storage Cells.
		Eating an Enchanted Golden Date from Atum grants you the same buffs as an Enchanted Golden Apple.
		Putting a food item on a Plate will make it taste way better (...for some reason)!
		Having trouble collecting Dragon's Breath because you're only getting Ender Air Bottles? Try to collect it without clicking on any End Stone! (You'll need to angle your clicks correctly.)

		Phantomfaces are your friends!
		You can create Seared Bricks by smelting Stone or Cobblestone in the Smeltery.
		Loading into the Nether for the first time might take some time. Be patient!
		The Aether Gold dungeon boss is pretty difficult. You can't damage it normally, you instead have to bounce Ice Balls back at it!
		AgriCraft lets you duplicate any crop using mutations. Since this is pretty OP (especially with Mystical Agriculture crops), Crop Sticks are gated very far into the pack!
		Snowballs and Enderpearls stack to 64.
		If you're having trouble organizing your ores from the Overworld, consider setting up a Quarry in the Deep Dark instead!
		Even though you can make an Aether portal right after visiting the Nether, you need a Crown of Skies to unlock the dimension!
		You have the option to explore the Twilight Forest, Atum, the Erebus, the Aether and Iceika in the first quarter of the pack!
		Flint & Steel takes Flint and STEEL! I know, very original...
		The Diesel Generator is VERY NOISY. You have been warned.
		All AE2 presses can exlusively be found in Meteors underground in Atum!
		Mob Grinding Utils are REALLY OP! Make good use of the mod!
		You can't unlock flight before the Twilight Forest, but you have access to the Roots Sky Soarer spell, Tinkers' Slime Boots & Slimestring.
		Dark Steel Armor is highly upgradable! Use a Dark Steel Anvil to apply them.
		Some Roots spells have been deemed too OP and are gated after certain tech mods.
